# NoTutorial
A mod for ULTRAKILL that prevents the tutorial from loading when starting new saves.

Install via [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/ultrakill/p/TRPG/NoTutorial/), or by following the steps below:

1. Download and install [BepInEx 5.4.21](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21) in your ULTRAKILL root folder. *Do not use any pre-release versions of BepInEx 6.*

2. Start ULTRAKILL once so that BepInEx can create its required configuration files.

3. Download `NoTutorial.dll` from the [Releases](https://github.com/TRPG0/BRC-NoTutorial/releases) page and put it into `BepInEx\plugins`.
